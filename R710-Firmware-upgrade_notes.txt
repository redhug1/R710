All the following downloaded files are self executing scripts, so once all downloaded, change them to be execurable:

	chmod +x *.BIN

LIFECYCLE CONTROLLER ... ensure both PSU's are of same wattage (if not, do upgrade with ONE PSU inserted at a time)

*** PSU updates - deselect them and do NOT do them as they can sometimes be problematic and might BRICK the PSU !

(from video:
	How to update BIOS and firmware using Dell Lifecycle Controller | what to do when it doesn't work 
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISA7j2BKgjI
)

To get the LIFECYCLE update, go to:
	dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/?c=us&|=en&s=bsd

and enter ther serial number or Service Tag of the machine

	OR search for "iDRAC with Lifecycle controller"

try updating this first and use it to update the rest:

Using "Lifecycle controller 2" to do updates:

For new web address to get updates from, See web page:

dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/sln292343/poweredge-server-lifecycle-controller-update?lang=en

Use Centos internal USB boot to achieve the update.

*** though after this update, in the video the network was no longer visible in the lifecycle controller ...

	SO ... it might be best to update individual components seperately !!! (and skip the lifecycle controller)

-=-=-

BIOS update:

https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-uk/product-support/product/poweredge-r710/drivers

to download:

BIOS_0F4YY_LN_6.6.0.BIN

*** check over video's again , after resetting everything to default ... 
	need to make sure the CPU is enabled for Hyper Threading OR whatever is needed and document here !!!


for red hat enterprise linux 7

and then use centos 7 usb boot ...

-=-=-

iDRAC update: (it might be iDRAC with Lifecycle Controller)

https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-uk/product-support/product/poweredge-r710/drivers

to download:

ESM_Firmware_KPCCC_LN32_2.92_A00.BIN

-=-=-

Network  ... when booted into centos terminal, type:

	ethtool -i em1

then:

	dmesg | grep bnx2 | more   ... or whatever description for the controller looks right

and then sus exact card details from results.

The final driver may be some qlogic part ... as they bought broadcom intellectual rights to the network
card stuff.

to see what network the motherboard has, then download the appropriate driver from:

https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-uk/product-support/product/poweredge-r710/drivers

OR ... 
	may have to do a google search for driver ...

but before going any further, go over the video from 30 minutes in to 33 minutes and look at the compatibility
list that is mentioned !!!

7.10.18 is a likely candidate, or maybe 7.12.17

Also look for SAS RAID Firmware, maybe something like:

	SAS-RAID_Firmware_F96NR_LN_6.3.3-0002_X00.BIN  ... or whatever suits particular RAID card ... PERC6

then watch min 33 onwards to end on applying these ...

---

pay attention for the "CTRL + E"  to get into the idrac configuration utility at ~ 46 minutes into video

	=> to do the RESET to default values (to RESET password, etc)

From video:
Dell PowerEdge R710 build PART 5/9 | CPU temperatures, noise levels, and power consumption 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTjgSw1OEA

With Centos booted:

	watch -n 1 sensors

in another terminal:

	sysbench --threads=24 -- time=60 cpu run

Then look at ~16 mins into video onwards to set up command line monitoring of best / worst cores during more testing

-=-=-

smartctl -a /dev/sd<x> | more    ... where <x> is a to z for whatever drive you are getting info for

'smartctl' can be installed with:

	yum install -y smartmontools

also try command:

	lsscsi

	lsusb

	df -h

To use iDrac's java (if any problems encountered) ...

See vid:

	How to fix Java for iDRAC6 virtual console 

	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drhSo9Xl9M0
	
		about 3 mins onwards into this vid.

	there is also a 2nd vid to vuew ...

-=-=-

Or, there is the "Dell EMC Repository Manager" to dowload an ISO that does all the updates ...

BUT the ISO needs adjusting to remove any PSU updates, etc
